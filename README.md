Unmotivated to exercise? Find yourself starting workout fads but quickly lose steam? Enter in the Workout Tracker, an app to record your progress and keep you on track! The workout tracker allows users to:

1. View, create, and track daily workouts.
2. Log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day.
3. Track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise.
4. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, the workout tracker keeps track of the distance traveled.

Here's how it works:

When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout, or continue with their last workout.

The user will be able to:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page.

Come see for yourself!
